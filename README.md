# SchoolProjects
This is where I'll upload projects I want my teachers to have the code access to
The main reason that this repository was first created was just so I could share a Study Guide project with my teacher
I couldn't find a way to upload a file to google docs and I was running out of time. I didn't want to stress myself any further
I had an existing github account so I decided that this would be my first repository. 
If I see fit I may create some other projects and upload them into the repository just for fun in my freetime
